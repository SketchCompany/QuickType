# Quick Type Language Support

This is the official node package, made for the official programming language "Quick Type", which is developed by the Sketch Company.
If you want to write short code and like to have the same results as in javascript, this is the perefect option for you!
You only need to install this package on your computer and after that you can start writing in Quick Type.
If you'd like to have some language support for Quick Type, you can install the [VS Code "Quick Type Language Support" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SketchCompany.qt-ls-sc).

## Usage
If you'd like to know how to use "Quick Type", you can visit our documentation at [our documentation website](https://docs.sketch-company.de).

## Changelog
This is the changelog of the language, not really the node package itself, because the version of the node package changes more often than the language itself. So don't worry about the versions, that the changelog shows, they are correct.
