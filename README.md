You only need to install this package on your computer and after that you can start writing in Quick Type.
If you'd like to have some language support for Quick Type, you can install the [VS Code "Quick Type Language Support" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SketchCompany.qt-ls-sc).
